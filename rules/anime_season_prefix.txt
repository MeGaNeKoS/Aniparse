Rule 1:  # is_anime_season_keyword
    A token is considered a valid anime season prefix if:
        a. The previous token is an ordinal (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd) or
        b. The next token is a number.
    However, if there is a "part" keyword followed by a digit after the ordinal or number, the token's validity depends on the season_part_as_unique option:
        a. If season_part_as_unique is enabled, the token is not considered a valid anime season prefix.
        b. If season_part_as_unique is disabled, the token is considered a valid anime season prefix.
